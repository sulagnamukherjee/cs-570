    <h2>Textbook</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>There is no required course textbook. Lecture notes will be provided.</li>
      <li>Lecture materials will be drawn from</li>
      <blockquote>
      <b>Algorithm Design</b> by Jon Kleinberg and Eva Tardos
      <p><b>Introduction to Algorithm</b> by Thomas H Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest and Cliff Stein
     </blockquote>
    </ul>

    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Students in the class are expected to have a reasonable degree of mathematical sophistication, and to be familiar with the basic notions of algorithms and data structures, discrete mathematics, and probability. More specifically the knowledge of the following prerequisite topics is a must:
  <ul>
    <li> Mathematical induction from discrete math</li>
    <li> Basics of graphs (directed, undirected, trees, adjacency list, cycles, DAG, BFS, DFS, etc.)</li>
    <li> Asymptotic notation (Big O, etc.)</li>
    <li> Sorting methods</li>
    <li> Basic data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues)</li>
  </ul>


    <h2>Grading</h2>

    Final grades for the course will be determined by a curve.
    We will compute the letter grade cutoffs by setting the mean score to be equal a B.

    <blockquote>
      <table>
        <tbody><tr class="noSpaceUnder"><td> Homeworks</td><td><b>0% </b> </td></tr>
        <tr class="noSpaceUnder"><td>First midterm exam</td><td><b>50% </b> </td> </tr>
        <tr class="noSpaceUnder"><td>Second midterm exam</td><td><b>50% </b> </td> </tr>

      </tbody></table>
    </blockquote>


    <h2>Exams</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>They will be offered on</li>
<blockquote>
Exam 1: Tue., Jun. 5 <br>
Exam 2: Tue., Jun. 19 <br>
</blockquote>
      <li>Each exam has 50% weight</li>

      <li>No makeup exams will be provided.</li>
      <li>If you skip the exam, you may be eligible for an IN grade for the course.
      The incomplete grade has to be completed within one year.
      Please read the University policy on IN grade for more details.</li>
	 <li>The exam solutions will always be posted.</li>
</ul>


    <h2>Homeworks</h2>

There will be nine (9) written assignments:
    <ul>
      <li>Each assignment has 0% weight</li>
      <li>Homework assignments should be submitted electronically  via Desire2learn: http://courses.uscden.net.</li>
      <li>Homework assignments are collected, graded and returned to students but homework grades do not count towards final grades </li>
      <li>Students are highly encouraged to submit assignments for grading since this provides them an
      opportunity to receive feedback on their work before exams.</li>
	 <li>There are NO late days for assignments.</li>
	 <li>The homework solutions will always be posted.</li>

    </ul>

<h2>Homework's Purpose</h2>
<p>Algorithms is a pivotal course in computer science studies.
The course's goal is to give you the basic principles in analyzing, designing and implementing algorithms
and data structures. The course will require a significant
amount of work on your part to follow what is taught in class and complete homework successfully.
We stress that the homework is an essential part of your course work. We devote a fairly large amount
of time for designing, writing, grading and explaining the homework, so that you can test yourselves and
see how well you understand and implement the course's material.</p>



<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>The USC <a href="http://scampus.usc.edu/" target="_blank">Student Conduct Code</a> prohibits <a href="http://scampus.usc.edu/" target="_blank">plagiarism</a>. All USC students are responsible for reading and
following the <a href="http://scampus.usc.edu/" target="_blank">Student Conduct Code</a>, which appears on SCampus.<br>
<p>In this course we encourage students to study together. This includes
discussing general strategies to be used on individual assignments. However, all
work submitted for the class is to be done individually.<br>
</p><p>Some examples of what is not allowed by the conduct code: copying all or part
of someone else's work (by hand or by looking at others' files, either secretly
or if shown), and submitting it as your own; giving another student in the class
a copy of your assignment solution; consulting with another student during an
exam. If you have questions about what is allowed, please discuss it with the
instructor.<br>
